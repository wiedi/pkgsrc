# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation  "System administrators office"

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
